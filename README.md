# Odin-Project-Tic-Tac-Toe
A Fun Game of Tic Tac Toe from The Odin Project

# Overview
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! This interactive game offers a great gaming experience for two players.

# How to Play
**Player Names** : To start the game, both players need to enter their names. This step is mandatory, and the game won't begin without it.

**Gameplay** : Player 1 (X) takes the first turn by selecting an empty cell to place their symbol. The turn alternates between players until the game's outcome is decided.

**Cell Selection** : Players can't choose a cell that already has a symbol. If you attempt to do so, an alert will prompt you to make a valid selection again.

**Win Conditions**: The winner is determined when three of their symbols are placed in a row, column, or diagonal.

**Tie Game** : If all cells are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

**Restart** : After a win or tie, you can easily restart the game with the same player names for another round of fun.
